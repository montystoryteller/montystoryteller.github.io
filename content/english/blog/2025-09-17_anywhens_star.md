Next Thursday, September 25th, 2025, from 7pm, I'll be back in [The Star](https://ryde.cafe/) along with Glenn'n'Sue, aka *The AnyWhens*, for a couple of hours turn taking songs'n'stories with a maritime time.

__Entry is free__, the beer is good, and so is the coffee, and the pizzas always hit the spot.

So why not pop the date in your diary to make a night of it, now the nights are drawing in, in one of the snuggest pubs in Ryde...
