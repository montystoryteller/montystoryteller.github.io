Next Thursday, Septemeber 25th, 2025, from 7pm, I'll be back in [The Star](https://ryde.cafe/) along with Glenn''n'Sue, aka *The AnyWhens*, for a couple of hours turn taking songs'n'stories with a maritime time.

Entry is free, the beer is good, so is the coffee, and the pizzas always hit the spot, so why not make a night of it, now the nights are starting to draw in, in one the snuggest pubs in Ryde...
