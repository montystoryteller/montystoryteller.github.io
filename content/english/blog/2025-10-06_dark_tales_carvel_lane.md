On Thursday, October 23rd, 2025, from 7pm, I'll be taking some *Dark Tales for Dark Nights* to [The Carvel Lane Coffee House, Cowes](https://www.instagram.com/carvellanecoffee/).

Dark forests, gibbets and gallows, and the devil will surely make an appearance somewhere along the way...

Tickets are just Â£5, advance reservation essential, from the *Carvel Lane Coffee House* or via [@carvellanecoffee [Instagram]](https://www.instagram.com/carvellanecoffee/).

This is a first solo trip for me to Cowes, in the most intimate of venues, for an inaugural *Tea Tales* full evening set. So when folk look back and say they were there at the start, you'll want to be able to truthfully say you were, right...?
