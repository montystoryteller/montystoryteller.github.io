> They were days of direct action: the Diggers and the Levellers, the Plug Drawer rioters and the Pentrich rebels; the followers of King Ludd, and of Captain Swing; of juries, and spies; of executions, and alibis.
>
> The tales of their actions are many; the songs of their deeds are still sung.
>
> And today? Today, their stories still deserve to be told, their songs still deserve to be sung; so prepare to sit back, and let the Protest tales begin.
>
> So let us take you on a journey, back to a time of machine breaking and mill attacks, of murder and marches, of stories and songs from the Ludding times.
