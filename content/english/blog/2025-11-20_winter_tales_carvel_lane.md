On Wednesday, December 10th, 2025, from 7pm, I'll be bringing some *Winter Tales* to [The Carvel Lane Coffee House, Cowes](https://www.instagram.com/carvellanecoffee/).

Following a hugely enjoyable trip to Cowes to tell a set of *Dark Tales for Dark Nights* at the end of October, I'll be returning to the Carvel Lane Coffee House in December for a seasonal set in this most intimate of venues.

The set will feature tales of seasonal wonder from the courts of Kings Arthur and Uther Pendragon (*Sir Gawain and the Green Knight*; *The Winter Cherries*), the strange tale of *The Cursed Dancers of Colbeck*, and a tale Grimm in origin, and grim by nature: *The Juniper Tree*.

Tickets are just £5, advance reservation essential, from the *Carvel Lane Coffee House* or via [@carvellanecoffee [Instagram]](https://www.instagram.com/carvellanecoffee/).

__If you fancy this event, please get your tickets reserved early.__ *It makes a huge difference knowing we have a viable show a week or two before the performance date, and if demand is strong enough, early enough, it opens up the possibility of getting another night booked in...*
