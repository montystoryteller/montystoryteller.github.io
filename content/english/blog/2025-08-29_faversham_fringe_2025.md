My third and final fringe festival outing of the year for my original "Unforeseen Consequences" show (first presented as *Unforeseen Consequences: Travelling the Road* in 2023).

> A young girl and her brother are given a secret that brings a community together, before a King’s purchase from a traveling tinker ruins his banqueting table. A family heirloom and a kindly deed bring other stories to mind, all in a world with too much time...

Features four traditional tales amd one original historical, all in a 1 hour show.

- Faversham Fringe — ALexander Center, Charter Room — Sunday 12/10/25, 1pm
- Tickets £6 + booking fee [available here](https://favershamfringe.co.uk/unforeseen-consequences)



*Appropriate all ages, aimed at adults.*
