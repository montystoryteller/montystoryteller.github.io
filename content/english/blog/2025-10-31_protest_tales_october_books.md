Just a little over a month to go to our first *Monty + The AnyWhens* show on the mainland on __Thursday, December 4th, 2025__, [October Books, Southampton](https://octoberbooks.org/) (doors 7pm).

Glenn popped in to have a scout around, and came out even more excited...

On the off-chance that anyone does fancy popiing over from the Island, the show should be over with plenty of time to catch the Red Jet back...

Or if you happen to be returning back to the Island from the mainland that day, why not catch the show *en route* home?!;-)
