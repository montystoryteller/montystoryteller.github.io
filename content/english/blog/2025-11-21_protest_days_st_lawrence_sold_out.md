Thanks to everyone for buying tickets in advance — it makes things far less stressful for everyone involved if we don't have to pour all our energy into trying to market things in the days immediately leading up to a show!

*There are still tickets available for the show at October Books in Southampton on Thursday, December 4th, 2025. So if missed getting tickets, and are on the Island, but need to make a Christmas shopping run to mainland, why not do both?!* [`Tickets available here`](https://octoberbooks.lemonbooking.com/events/116/details)

*And if you'd like to see the show run again somewhere else, please [get in touch](/contact/).*
