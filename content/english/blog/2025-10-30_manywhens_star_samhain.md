A quarter day celebration, of Samhain, Hallowe'en, All Saints Day and All Souls Day, that time of the year when the vel between this world and the other world is at its thinnest, a time for story, and song, and beer, and pizza...

So why not join *Monty + The AnyWhens* [aka Glenn'n'Sue] at [The Star](https://ryde.cafe/) in Ryde, for a couple of hours turn taking songs'n'dark stories on Saturday, November 1st, 2025, from 7pm-ish.

As ever with our *Star* shows, __entry is free__, the beer is good, and so is the coffee, and the pizzas always hit the spot.
