At my *Dark Tales* show at Carvel Lane Coffee House in Cowes — a great venue and one I hope to return too as soon as we can fix a date — I did a "soft (re)launch" of the first two booklets in the [*Island Tales* storynotes series](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0FVYBY4V8): *A Legend of Godshill*, and A Legend of Puckaster Cove*.

I had previously printed a few copies of these on-demand using Lulu, but I've modified my production route (abut which I'll post a blog post another day, maybe), and moved to Amazon KDP (Kindle Direct Publishing).

This is still print on demand, but it's a bit cheaper, and also hooks into Amazon online sales and Kindle publishing

The first two installments in this *Island Tales* series build on tales penned by Abraham Elder.

- *A Legend of Godshill* reproduces Elder's version of the tale as well as my take on it, Percy Stone's lay, excerpts from 19th century tourist guides, and a biographical note on Abraham Elder;

- *A Legend of Puckaster Cove* includes Elder's original version of the tale, something approximating my first retelling of it a couple or more years ago, and some historical notes that once again pull on 19th century travel guides to the Island.

Whenever I do a show in future, I'll try to bring a copy or two of the booklets along, at a discounted price. But they're also up on Amazon:

- *A Legend of Godshill* — [Amazon: *paperback and ebook*](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Legend-Puckaster-Cove-Island-Tales/dp/B0FPN7VCVK/)
- *A Legend of Puckaster Cove* — [Amazon: *paperback and ebook*](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Legend-Godshill-Island-Tales/dp/B0FPRFD1QS/)
