On Saturday, October 4th, 2025, from 6.30pm, there's a *Harvest Folk Night* at Newport Minster, featuring local folk bands (*Second Time Around*, *Jess & Al*, *The AnyWhens*) and yours truly taking turns tellin' a couple of tales during band changeovers.

*[06/10/25] PS In the introduction to the event, an announcement was made regarding a series of free "long table" lunches in the Minster over Harvest week that allegedly recalled "farmers table" lunches at harvest time. This put me in mind of telling a `Stone Soup` variant, to complement the `Four Seasons` (Syrian folk tale), I'd already decided to tell. I popped along to the lunch today, and had a fantastic Island-grown tomato soup and some good conversation with folk I hadn't before.*
