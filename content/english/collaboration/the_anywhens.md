## AnyWhens Biography

__The AnyWhens *(Glenn Koppany and Sue Cain)*__ are an Isle of Wight based duo regularly performing in pubs, folk clubs and festivals on the Island and the mainland. They play a mix of folk and blues but have a particular interest in historical songs, diversity and songs of the sea. As well as performing traditional and contemporary folk music to their own arrangements they write and perform their own songs. Dark themes, love songs, songs of working class history and diversity played to foot tapping rhythms or melancholy tunes. A memorable duo who are quickly building an enthusiastic following.

Glenn has been writing songs for 40 years finding inspiration in many areas but particularly keen on historical songs that tell the experience of ordinary people. Living on the Isle of Wight, he takes great inspiration from stories of the sea, as well as writing about historical events, working people, social reformers and the promotion of diversity. His recently written song of the Plug Drawers and child labour in the Yorkshire Mills in the 1800's was inspired by a holiday visit to Hebden Bridge. He wrote and presented a play "Whatever Happened to Tom O' Bedlam" set in the late 17th Century recounting the last days of these notable itinerant beggars and over lockdown extended the play into a book. As well as performing in pubs, clubs and at festivals Glenn also works in music therapy."

Sue’s love of folk singing began when she started Morris dancing in the late 90s, moved to Sheffield and went on to front Sheffield based folk-rock band, Silverwheel, before becoming part of a cappella harmony group The Fates.  She was often found hosting pub music sessions and co-hosting song walks around Sheffield’s industrial areas where any excuse was found to share stories & songs of radical history, industrial heritage, entertaining criminality, beer and fish. Since returning to the Isle of Wight in 2022, Sue has joined forces with Glenn Koppany in The Anywhens adding harmonies, ukelele and percussion, co-hosts the Pride folk club & sings sea songs & Shanties whenever possible. Sue still finds time to head up North, often for song walks and singing sessions dedicated to protest, industry & entertaining characters of the past.
