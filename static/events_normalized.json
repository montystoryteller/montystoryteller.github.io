This is not just a wild myth retold. It's an exploration of what it means to live, to regret, to sacrifice, and to endure in a relentless world.\n\n\n\n What will survive the tide? \n\n\n\n This performance is followed by an opportunity for post-show discussion and is part of a Research and Development project funded by the Arts Council of England.\n\n\n\n Two halves 60 mins. Age recommendation 16 +\n\n\n\n  Content advice: This show contains references to threat, violence and mutilation, incest, death in childbirth, and suicide, all contextualised within a paradigm of mythic narrative, archetype and metaphor.",

      "description": "Beowulf is the oldest story in the English language - and it still has the power to raise the hairs on the back of the neck!\n\n\n\n It tells of a hero's life, a life that is mapped by three tremendous blood- curdling encounters.\n\n\n\n As a young man Beowulf defeats the monster Grendel and his even more terrifying Mother, the original creatures from the Black Lagoon. Then, as an old man, he tries his strength against a gold guarding Fire - Drake(a dragon).\n\n\n\n Alongside these adrenalin - charged encounters the story explores the journey we all make from the seeming invincibility of youth to the heroic vulnerability of old age. The story has had a tremendous effect on the imagination of many writers and poets, most notably J.R.R. Tolkien. Without Beowulf there would have been no Lord of the Rings.\n\n\n\n 'Impossibly engaging storytelling' The Guardian\n\n\n\n Aimed at adults.",

As the windows rattle and the optics glow, their memories grow hazy but they cling to the stories that have nourished them on their journeys. But why are they there? And who is calling for them from the upstairs bar, ever more insistently? Inspired by The Canterbury Tales, the Cohen Brothers and quite a few lost nights in the pub, Mike Payton reflects on the stories that make us and keep us tethered to the world.

In many myths the giants come first, often preceding even the gods themselves, frequently waiting for the human explorers of new lands.\n\n\n\n Often a force of oppression, representing the tyranny of might, some have their beginnings in the power of nature, some in actual people who have been exaggerated over the years and some we can only guess at.",

Join us for darkness and light, for stories from near and afar...\n\n\n\n Laura Sampson will be sharing 'Yamanba (or, She'll be Coming Round the Mountain)'.\n\n\n\n A tree floats down a river from the mountain and becomes a sacred statue: compassion personified. At the river's source squats an old, old lady whose fury can eat you alive, or keep you as safe as if you yourself were the mountain.\n\n\n\n People call her a demon - but once she was a goddess. Maybe. Who is she really? And in a time when youth, beauty and granted wishes are all that matters, who even cares?\n\n\n\n For years, the figure of Yamanba has led Laura a merry dance round the mountain to the myths, legends and parables of East Asia - plus the outer reaches of her own unenlightened mind - chasing the echo of a being that can still, if she wants to, raise holy hell.\n\n\n\n Laura Sampson is a British-Trinidadian storyteller, author and Japanese noh practitioner based in London. She tells stories of big emotions, surreal situations, and misunderstood old ladies - from all over the world.\n\n\n\n In the first half, Stacey Blythe will be singing and storytelling bilingually in Welsh and English. Stacey and her harp and accordion are always inside the telling, weaving music and magic through each story. You're invited to listen and to sing together in these stories.",

Folk / Punk festival favourite, Brookfield has been at this for a while now. Since winning Acoustic Magazine Singer/ Songwriter of the year way back in 2010 he has continued to tirelessly tour the length and breadth of the country, building a strong and loyal following where he goes. \n\n\n\n His last album, Morning Walking Club, saw Gaz achieve his first top 40 record, and it even got number 1 in the UK Official Folk Charts. Not a bad result for this fiercely independent musician, with no record label, no manager, and no agent — just a guitar, a van, and a steadfastly belligerent refusal to give in.",
